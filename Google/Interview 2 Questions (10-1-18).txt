Compare text part of two DOM trees.
For example, these two are equivalent:
  <html><p>He</p><p>ll</p><p>o</p></html>
  <html><p><b>H</b>ello</p></html>

  class Node:
    	def __init__(self, tag, text):
      		self.tag = tag # tag is not None for tag node
      		self.text = text # text is None for tag node
      		self.children = []

Follow-ups: Why the solution will crash with big tree?
Follow-ups: How can you fix it?
